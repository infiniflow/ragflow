    A thread-safe decorator that ensures the decorated function runs exactly once,

    race conditions in multi-threaded environments by using a lock to protect
    the execution state.

        func (callable): The function to be executed only once.

    Returns:
        callable: A wrapper function that executes `func` on the first call
                  and returns the cached result thereafter.

    Example:
        @once
        def compute_expensive_value():
            print("Computing...")
            return 42
