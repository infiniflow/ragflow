# Launch RAGFlow MCP server

Launch an MCP server from source or via Docker.

---

A RAGFlow Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is designed as an independent component to complement the RAGFlow server. Note that an MCP server must operate alongside a properly functioning RAGFlow server. 

An MCP server can start up in either self-host mode (default) or host mode: 

- **Self-host mode**:  
  When launching an MCP server in self-host mode, you must provide an API key to authenticate the MCP server with the RAGFlow server. In this mode, the MCP server can access *only* the datasets of a specified tenant on the RAGFlow server.
- **Host mode**:  
  In host mode, each MCP client can access their own datasets on the RAGFlow server. However, each client request must include a valid API key to authenticate the client with the RAGFlow server.

Once a connection is established, an MCP server communicates with its client in MCP HTTP+SSE (Server-Sent Events) mode, unidirectionally pushing responses from the RAGFlow server to its client in real time.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure RAGFlow is upgraded to v0.18.0 or later.
2. Have your RAGFlow API key ready. See [Acquire a RAGFlow API key](../acquire_ragflow_api_key.md).

## Launch an MCP server 

You can start an MCP server either from source code or via Docker. 

### Launch from source code

1. Ensure that a RAGFlow server v0.18.0+ is properly running.
2. Launch the MCP server:


```bash
# Launch the MCP server to work in self-host mode, run either of the following
uv run mcp/server/server.py --host=127.0.0.1 --port=9382 --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:9380 --api-key=ragflow-xxxxx
# uv run mcp/server/server.py --host=127.0.0.1 --port=9382 --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:9380 --mode=self-host --api-key=ragflow-xxxxx

# To launch the MCP server to work in host mode, run the following instead:
# uv run mcp/server/server.py --host=127.0.0.1 --port=9382 --base-url=http://127.0.0.1:9380 --mode=host
```

Where: 

- `host`: The MCP server's host address.
- `port`: The MCP server's listening port.
- `base_url`: The address of the running RAGFlow server.
- `mode`: The launch mode.
  - `self-host`: (default) self-host mode.
  - `host`: host mode.
- `api_key`: Required in self-host mode to authenticate the MCP server with the RAGFlow server. See [here](../acquire_ragflow_api_key.md) for instructions on acquiring an API key.

### Transports

The RAGFlow MCP server supports two transports: the legacy SSE transport (served at `/sse`), introduced on November 5, 2024 and deprecated on March 26, 2025, and the streamable-HTTP transport (served at `/mcp`). The legacy SSE transport and the streamable HTTP transport with JSON responses are enabled by default. To disable either transport, use the flags `--no-transport-sse-enabled` or `--no-transport-streamable-http-enabled`. To disable JSON responses for the streamable HTTP transport,  use the `--no-json-response` flag.

### Launch from Docker

#### 1. Enable MCP server

The MCP server is designed as an optional component that complements the RAGFlow server and disabled by default. To enable MCP server:

1. Navigate to **docker/docker-compose.yml**.
2. Uncomment the `services.ragflow.command` section as shown below:

```yaml {6-13}
  services:
    ragflow:
      ...
      image: ${RAGFLOW_IMAGE}
      # Example configuration to set up an MCP server:
      command:
        - --enable-mcpserver
        - --mcp-host=0.0.0.0
        - --mcp-port=9382
        - --mcp-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:9380
        - --mcp-script-path=/ragflow/mcp/server/server.py
        - --mcp-mode=self-host
        - --mcp-host-api-key=ragflow-xxxxxxx
        # Optional transport flags for the RAGFlow MCP server.
        # If you set `mcp-mode` to `host`, you must add the --no-transport-streamable-http-enabled flag, because the streamable-HTTP transport is not yet supported in host mode.
        # The legacy SSE transport and the streamable-HTTP transport with JSON responses are enabled by default.
        # To disable a specific transport or JSON responses for the streamable-HTTP transport, use the corresponding flag(s):
        #   - --no-transport-sse-enabled # Disables the legacy SSE endpoint (/sse)
        #   - --no-transport-streamable-http-enabled #  Disables the streamable-HTTP transport (served at the /mcp endpoint)
        #   - --no-json-response # Disables JSON responses for the streamable-HTTP transport
```

Where: 

- `mcp-host`: The MCP server's host address.
- `mcp-port`: The MCP server's listening port.
- `mcp-base-url`: The address of the running RAGFlow server.
- `mcp-script-path`: The file path to the MCP server‚Äôs main script.
- `mcp-mode`: The launch mode.
  - `self-host`: (default) self-host mode.
  - `host`: host mode.
- `mcp-host-api_key`: Required in self-host mode to authenticate the MCP server with the RAGFlow server. See [here](../acquire_ragflow_api_key.md) for instructions on acquiring an API key.

:::tip INFO
If you set `mcp-mode` to `host`, you must add the `--no-transport-streamable-http-enabled` flag, because the streamable-HTTP transport is not yet supported in host mode.
:::

#### 2. Launch a RAGFlow server with an MCP server

Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up` to launch the RAGFlow server together with the MCP server.

#### Launch an MCP server without upgrading RAGFlow

:::info KUDOS
This section is contributed by our community contributor [yiminghub2024](https://github.com/yiminghub2024). üëè
:::

1. Prepare all MCP-specific files and directories.  
   i. Copy the [mcp/](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/tree/main/mcp) directory to your local working directory.  
   ii. Copy [docker/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) locally.  
   iii. Copy [docker/entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/main/docker/entrypoint.sh) locally.  
   iv. Install the required dependencies using `uv`:  
       - Run `uv add mcp` or
       - Copy [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/main/pyproject.toml) locally and run `uv sync --python 3.10`.
2. Edit **docker-compose.yml** to enable MCP (disabled by default).
3. Launch the MCP server:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Check MCP server status

Run the following to check the logs the RAGFlow server and the MCP server:

```bash
docker logs docker-ragflow-cpu-1
```

## Security considerations

As MCP technology is still at early stage and no official best practices for authentication or authorization have been established, RAGFlow currently uses [API key](./acquire_ragflow_api_key.md) to validate identity for the operations described earlier. However, in public environments, this makeshift solution could expose your MCP server to potential network attacks. Therefore, when running a local SSE server, it is recommended to bind only to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) rather than to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`). 

For further guidance, see the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#security-considerations).

## Frequently asked questions

### When to use an API key for authentication?

The use of an API key depends on the operating mode of your MCP server. 

- **Self-host mode** (default):  
  When starting the MCP server in self-host mode, you should provide an API key when launching it to authenticate it with the RAGFlow server:  
  - If launching from source, include the API key in the command. 
  - If launching from Docker, update the API key in **docker/docker-compose.yml**.
- **Host mode**:  
  If your RAGFlow MCP server is working in host mode, include the API key in the `headers` of your client requests to authenticate your client with the RAGFlow server. An example is available [here](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/main/mcp/client/client.py).
