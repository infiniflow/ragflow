# Build a RAGFlow Docker Image
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

A guide explaining how to build a RAGFlow Docker image from its source code. By following this guide, you'll be able to create a local Docker image that can be used for development, debugging, or testing purposes.

## Target Audience

- Developers who have added new features or modified the existing code and require a Docker image to view and debug their changes.
- Testers looking to explore the latest features of RAGFlow in a Docker image.

## Prerequisites

- CPU &ge; 4 cores
- RAM &ge; 16 GB
- Disk &ge; 50 GB
- Docker &ge; 24.0.0 & Docker Compose &ge; v2.26.1

:::tip NOTE
If you have not installed Docker on your local machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux), see the [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) guide.

## Build a Docker image

<Tabs
  defaultValue="without"
  values={[
    {label: 'Build a Docker image without embedding models', value: 'without'},
    {label: 'Build a Docker image including embedding models', value: 'including'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="without">

This image is approximately 1 GB in size and relies on external LLM and embedding services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
pip3 install huggingface-hub nltk
python3 download_deps.py
docker build -f Dockerfile.slim -t infiniflow/ragflow:dev-slim .
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="including">

## Build a Docker image including embedding models

This image is approximately 9 GB in size. As it includes embedding models, it relies on external LLM services only.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow.git
cd ragflow/
pip3 install huggingface-hub nltk
python3 download_deps.py
docker build -f Dockerfile -t infiniflow/ragflow:dev .
```
