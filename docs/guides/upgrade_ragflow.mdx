## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to back up my datasets before upgrading RAGFlow?

No, you do not need to. Upgrading RAGFlow in itself will *not* remove your uploaded data or dataset settings. However, be aware that `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v` will remove Docker container volumes, resulting in data loss.

### Upgrade RAGFlow in an offline environment (without Internet access)

1. From an environment with Internet access, pull the required Docker image.
2. Save the Docker image to a **.tar** file.
   ```bash
   docker save -o ragflow.v0.22.1.tar infiniflow/ragflow:v0.22.1
   ```
3. Copy the **.tar** file to the target server.
4. Load the **.tar** file into Docker:
   ```bash
   docker load -i ragflow.v0.22.1.tar
   ```
