A checklist to speed up document parsing and question answering.

---

Please note that some of your settings may consume a significant amount of time. If you often find that document parsing and question answering are time-consuming, here is a checklist to consider:

## 1. Accelerate document indexing

- Use GPU to reduce embedding time.
- On the configuration page of your knowledge base, toggle off **Use RAPTOR to enhance retrieval**.
- The **Knowledge Graph** chunk method (GraphRAG) is time-consuming.
- Disable **Auto-keyword** and **Auto-question** on the configuration page of yor knowledge base, as both depend on the LLM.

## 2. Accelerate question answering

- In the **Prompt Engine** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, disabling **Multi-turn optimization** will reduce the time required to get an answer from the LLM.
- In the **Prompt Engine** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, leaving the **Rerank model** field empty will significantly decrease retrieval time.
- In the **Assistant Setting** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, disabling **Keyword analysis** will reduce the time to get get an answer from the LLM.
-  When chatting with your chat assistant, click the light bubble icon above the *current* dialogue and scroll down the popup window to view the time taken for each task:
