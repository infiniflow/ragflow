# Manage team members

Invite or remove team members, join or leave a team.

By default, each RAGFlow user is assigned a single team named after their name. RAGFlow allows you to invite RAGFlow users to your team. Your team members can help you:

- Upload documents to your datasets.
- Update document configurations in your datasets.
- Parse documents in your datasets.

:::tip NOTE
Team members are currently *not* allowed to invite users to your team, and only you, the team owner, is permitted to do so.

To enter the **Team** page, click on your avatar on the top right corner of the page **>** Team:

![team](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eac2503-26bc-4568-b3f2-bcd84069a07a)

_On the **Team** page, you can view the information about members of your team and the teams you have joined._

## Invite team members

You are, by default, the owner of your own team and the only person permitted to invite users to join your team or remove team members.
