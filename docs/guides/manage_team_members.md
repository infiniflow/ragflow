# Team

Invite or remove team members, join or leave a team.

---

By default, each RAGFlow user is assigned a single team named after their name. RAGFlow allows you to invite RAGFlow users to your team. Your team members can help you:

- Upload documents to your datasets (knowledge bases).
- Update document configurations in your datasets.
- Update the default configurations for your datasets.
- Parse documents in your datasets.

:::tip NOTE
Team members are currently *not* allowed to invite users to your team, and only you, the team owner, is permitted to do so.
