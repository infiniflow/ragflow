# Manage team members

Invite or remove team members, join or leave a team.

By default, each RAGFlow user is assigned a single team named after their nickname. RAGFlow allows you to invite an unlimited number of RAGFlow users to your team. Your team members will automatically have the same permissions on your datasets, helping you:

- Update or configure existing datasets (knowledge bases).
- Upload and parse documents to datasets.
- Delete existing datasets.
- Create datasets.

To enter the **Team** page, click on your avatar on the top right corner of the page **>** Team.

## Invite team members

You are, by default, the owner of your own team and the only person permitted to invite or remove team members.
