## Key concepts

Agents and RAG are complementary techniques, each enhancing the otherâ€™s capabilities in business applications. RAGFlow v0.8.0 introduces an agent mechanism, featuring a no-code workflow editor on the front end and a comprehensive graph-based task orchestration framework on the back end. This mechanism is built on top of RAGFlow's existing RAG solutions and aims to orchestrate search technologies such as query intent classification, conversation leading, and query rewriting to:

- Provide higher retrievals and,
- Accommodate more complex scenarios.

## Create an agent

:::tip NOTE

Before proceeding, ensure that:  

1. You have properly set the LLM to use. See the guides on [Configure your API key](../models/llm_api_key_setup.md) or [Deploy a local LLM](../models/deploy_local_llm.mdx) for more information.
2. You have a knowledge base configured and the corresponding files properly parsed. See the guide on [Configure a knowledge base](../dataset/configure_knowledge_base.md) for more information.
