# Title chunker component

A component that splits texts into chunks by heading level.

A **Token chunker** component is a text splitter that uses specified heading level as delimiter to define chunk boundaries and create chunks.

## Scenario

A **Title chunker** component is optional, usually placed immediately after **Parser**.

:::caution WARNING
Placing a **Title chunker** after a **Token chunker** is invalid and will cause an error. Please note that this restriction is not currently system-enforced and requires your attention.
