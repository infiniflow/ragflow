# Transformer component

A component that uses an LLM to extract insights from the chunks.

---

A **Transformer** component indexes chunks and configures their storage formats in the document engine. It *typically* precedes the **Indexer** in the ingestion pipeline, but you can also chain multiple **Transformer** components in sequence.

## Scenario

A **Transformer** component is essential when you need the LLM to extract new information, such as keywords, questions, metadata, and summaries, from the original chunks. 

## Configurations

### Model

Click the dropdown menu of **Model** to show the model configuration window.

- **Model**: The chat model to use.  
  - Ensure you set the chat model correctly on the **Model providers** page.
  - You can use different models for different components to increase flexibility or improve overall performance.
- **Creativity**: A shortcut to **Temperature**, **Top P**, **Presence penalty**, and **Frequency penalty** settings, indicating the freedom level of the model. From **Improvise**, **Precise**, to **Balance**, each preset configuration corresponds to a unique combination of **Temperature**, **Top P**, **Presence penalty**, and **Frequency penalty**.   
  This parameter has three options:
  - **Improvise**: Produces more creative responses.
  - **Precise**: (Default) Produces more conservative responses.
  - **Balance**: A middle ground between **Improvise** and **Precise**.
- **Temperature**: The randomness level of the model's output.  
  Defaults to 0.1.
  - Lower values lead to more deterministic and predictable outputs.
  - Higher values lead to more creative and varied outputs.
  - A temperature of zero results in the same output for the same prompt.
- **Top P**: Nucleus sampling.  
  - Reduces the likelihood of generating repetitive or unnatural text by setting a threshold *P* and restricting the sampling to tokens with a cumulative probability exceeding *P*.
  - Defaults to 0.3.
- **Presence penalty**: Encourages the model to include a more diverse range of tokens in the response.  
  - A higher **presence penalty** value results in the model being more likely to generate tokens not yet been included in the generated text.
  - Defaults to 0.4.
- **Frequency penalty**: Discourages the model from repeating the same words or phrases too frequently in the generated text.  
  - A higher **frequency penalty** value results in the model being more conservative in its use of repeated tokens.
  - Defaults to 0.7.
- **Max tokens**:  
  This sets the maximum length of the model's output, measured in the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). It is disabled by default, allowing the model to determine the number of tokens in its responses.

:::tip NOTE
- It is not necessary to stick with the same model for all components. If a specific model is not performing well for a particular task, consider using a different one.
- If you are uncertain about the mechanism behind **Temperature**, **Top P**, **Presence penalty**, and **Frequency penalty**, simply choose one of the three options of **Creativity**.

### Result destination

Select the type of output to be generated by the LLM:

- Summary
- Keywords
- Questions
- Metadata

### System prompt

Typically, you use the system prompt to describe the task for the LLM, specify how it should respond, and outline other miscellaneous requirements. We do not plan to elaborate on this topic, as it can be as extensive as prompt engineering. 

:::tip NOTE
The system prompt here automatically updates to match your selected **Result destination**.
:::

### User prompt

The user-defined prompt. For example, you can type `/` or click **(x)** to insert variables of preceding components in the ingestion pipeline as the LLM's input.

### Output

The global variable name for the output of the **Transformer** component, which can be referenced by subsequent **Transformer** components in the ingestion pipeline.

- Default: `chunks`
- Type: `Array<Object>`
