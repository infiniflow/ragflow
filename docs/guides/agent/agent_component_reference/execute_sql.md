# Execute SQL tool

A tool that execute SQL queries on a specified relational database.

---

The **Execute SQL** tool enables you to connect to a relational database and run SQL queries, whether entered directly or generated by the systemâ€™s Text2SQL capability via an **Agent** component. It currently supports three popular databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

## Prerequisites

- A database instance properly configured and running.
- The database must be one of the following types:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - MariaDB

## Examples

You can pair an **Agent** component with the **Execute SQL** tool, with the **Agent** generating SQL statements and the **Execute SQL** tool handling database connection and query execution. An example of this setup can be found in the **SQL Assistant** Agent template shown below:
