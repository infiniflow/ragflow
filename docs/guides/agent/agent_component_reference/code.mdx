# Code component

A component that enables users to integrate Python or JavaScript codes into their Agent for dynamic data processing.

---

## Scenarios

A **Code** component is essential when you need to integrate complex code logic (Python or JavaScript) into your Agent for dynamic data processing.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Ensure gVisor is properly installed

We use gVisor to isolate code execution from the host system. Please follow [the official installation guide](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/) to install gVisor, ensuring your operating system is compatible before proceeding.

### 2. Ensure Sandbox is properly installed

RAGFlow Sandbox is a secure, pluggable code execution backend. It serves as the code executor for the **Code** component. Please follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/tree/main/sandbox) to install RAGFlow Sandbox.

:::tip NOTE
If your RAGFlow Sandbox is not working, please be sure to consult the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section in this document. We assure you that it addresses 99.99% of the issues!
:::

### 3. (Optional) Install necessary dependencies

If you need to import your own Python or JavaScript packages into Sandbox, please follow the commands provided in the [How to import my own Python or JavaScript packages into Sandbox?](#how-to-import-my-own-python-or-javascript-packages-into-sandbox) section to install the additional dependencies. 

### 4. Enable Sandbox-specific settings in RAGFlow

Ensure all Sandbox-specific settings are enabled in **ragflow/docker/.env**.

### 5. Restart the service after making changes

Any changes to the configuration or environment *require* a full service restart to take effect.

## Configurations 

### Input

You can specify multiple input sources for the **Code** component. Click **+ Add variable** in the **Input variables** section to include the desired input variables. 

### Code

This field allows you to enter and edit your source code.

#### A Python code example

```Python 
    def main(arg1: str, arg2: str) -> dict:
        return {
            "result": arg1 + arg2,
        }
```

#### A JavaScript code example

```JavaScript

    const axios = require('axios');
    async function main(args) {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow');
        console.log('Body:', response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
      }
    }
```

### Return values

You define the output variable(s) of the **Code** component here.

### Output

The defined output variable(s) will be auto-populated here.

## Troubleshooting

### `HTTPConnectionPool(host='sandbox-executor-manager', port=9385): Read timed out.`

**Root cause**  

- You did not properly install gVisor and `runsc` was not recognized as a valid Docker runtime.
- You did not pull the required base images for the runners and no runner was started.

**Solution**

For the gVisor issue:

1. Install [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/).
2. Restart Docker.
3. Run the following to double check:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --runtime=runsc hello-world
   ```

For the base image issue, pull the required base images:

```bash
docker pull infiniflow/sandbox-base-nodejs:latest
docker pull infiniflow/sandbox-base-python:latest
```

### `HTTPConnectionPool(host='none', port=9385): Max retries exceeded.`

**Root cause**  

`sandbox-executor-manager` is not mapped in `/etc/hosts`.

**Solution**  

Add a new entry to `/etc/hosts`:

`127.0.0.1 es01 infinity mysql minio redis sandbox-executor-manager`

### `Container pool is busy`

**Root cause**  

All runners are currently in use, executing tasks. 

**Solution**  

Please try again shortly or increase the pool size in the configuration to improve availability and reduce waiting times.
