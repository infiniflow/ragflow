# Variable component

This is a component that allows users to extract data, store it, and reuse it throughout the conversation process.

---
A **Variable** component acts as a storage for variables. It is typically placed after the **Interface** component.

The component will return the initial question from the user, which can be used for other components in the flow, and will also store variable values.

**Variable Attributes**
To retrieve information from the user's question, variables will be declared explicitly with empty values. 
Here is an example of how to declare variables to extract information such as: the user's name, the language of the latest question, the topic of the question, and the question itself.

```json
{
   "The languages of the latest question": "",
   "Topic": "",
   "UserName": "",
   "Question": ""
}
```
