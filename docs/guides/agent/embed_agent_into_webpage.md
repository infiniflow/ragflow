# Embed agent into webpage

You can use iframe to embed an agent into a third-party webpage.

:::caution WARNING
If your agent's **Begin** component takes a key of **file** type (a **file** type variable), you *cannot* embed it into a webpage.
:::

1. Before proceeding, you must [acquire an API key](../models/llm_api_key_setup.md); otherwise, an error message would appear.
2. On the **Agent** page, click an intended agent **>** **Edit** to access its editing page.
3. Click **Embed into webpage** on the top right corner of the canvas to show the **iframe** window:

   ![agent_embed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f748bb91-1a48-45ca-89ea-5b1c257407cb)

4. Copy the iframe and embed it into a specific location on your webpage.
