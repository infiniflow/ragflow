# Accelerate answering
import APITable from '@site/src/components/APITable';

A checklist to speed up question answering.

---

Please note that some of your settings may consume a significant amount of time. If you often find that your question answering is time-consuming, here is a checklist to consider:

- In the **Prompt engine** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, disabling **Multi-turn optimization** will reduce the time required to get an answer from the LLM.
- In the **Prompt engine** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, leaving the **Rerank model** field empty will significantly decrease retrieval time.
- When using a rerank model, ensure you have a GPU for acceleration; otherwise, the reranking process will be *prohibitively* slow.

:::tip NOTE 
Please note that rerank models are essential in certain scenarios. There is always a trade-off between speed and performance; you must weigh the pros against cons for your specific case.
:::

- In the **Assistant settings** tab of your **Chat Configuration** dialogue, disabling **Keyword analysis** will reduce the time to receive an answer from the LLM.
- When chatting with your chat assistant, click the light bulb icon above the *current* dialogue and scroll down the popup window to view the time taken for each task:
