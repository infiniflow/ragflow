When ready, you may share your datasets with your team members so that they can upload and parse files in them. Please note that your datasets are not shared automatically; you must manually enable sharing by selecting the appropriate **Permissions** radio button:

1. Navigate to the dataset's **Configuration** page.
2. Change **Permissions** from **Only me** to **Team**.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

*Once completed, your team members will see your shared datasets.*
