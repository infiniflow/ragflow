When ready, you may share your knowledge bases with your team members so that they can upload and parse files in them. Please note that your knowledge bases are not shared automatically; you must manually enable sharing by selecting the appropriate **Permissions** radio button:

1. Navigate to the knowledge base's **Configuration** page.
2. Change **Permissions** from **Only me** to **Team**.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
