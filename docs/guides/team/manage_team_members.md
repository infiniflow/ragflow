# Manage team members

Invite or remove team members.

---

By default, each RAGFlow user is assigned a single team named after their name. RAGFlow allows you to invite RAGFlow users to your team. Your team members can help you:

- Upload documents to your shared datasets (knowledge bases).
- Parse documents in your shared datasets.
- Use your shared Agents.

:::tip NOTE
- Your team members are currently *not* allowed to invite users to your team, and only you, the team owner, is permitted to do so.
- Sharing added models with team members is only available in RAGFlow's Enterprise edition.
:::

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the invited team member is a RAGFlow user and that the Email address used is associated with a RAGFlow user account.
2. To allow your team members to view and update your knowledge base, ensure that you set **Permissions** on its **Configuration** page from **Only me** to **Team**.

## Invite team members

Click on your avatar in the top right corner of the page, then select **Team** in the left-hand panel to access the **Team** page.

_On the **Team** page, you can view the information about members of your team and the teams you have joined._

You are, by default, the owner of your own team and the only person permitted to invite users to join your team or remove team members.
