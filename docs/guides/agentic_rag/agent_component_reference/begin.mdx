# Begin component

The starting component in a workflow.

---

The **Begin** component sets an opening greeting or accepts inputs from the user. It is automatically populated onto the canvas when you create an agent, whether from a template or from scratch (from a blank template). There should be only one **Begin** component in the workflow.

## Scenarios

A **Begin** component is essential in all cases. Every agent includes a **Begin** component, which cannot be deleted.

## Configurations

Click the component to display its **Configuration** window. Here, you can set an opening greeting and the input parameters (global variables) for the agent.

### ID

The ID is the unique identifier for the component within the workflow. Unlike the IDs of other components, the ID of the **Begin** component *cannot* be changed.

### Opening greeting

An opening greeting is the agent's first message to the user. It can be a welcoming remark or an instruction to guide the user forward.

### Global variables

You can set global variables within the **Begin** component, which can be either required or optional. Once established, users will need to provide values for these variables when interacting with the agent. Click **+ Add variable** to add a global variable, each with the following attributes:

- **Key**: *Required*  
  The unique variable name.
- **Name**: *Required*  
  An expanded variable name providing additional details about the variable.  
  For example, if **Key** is set to `lang`, you can set its **Name** to `Target language`
- **Type**: *Required*  
  The type of the variable:  
  - **line**: Accepts a text line without line break.
  - **paragraph**: Accepts multiple text lines including line breaks.
  - **options**: The user must select a value for this variable from the dropdown menu. And you are required to set *at least* one option for the dropdown menu.
  - **file**: Accepts file upload
- **Optional**: A toggle that sets whether the corresponding variable is optional. 

## Examples

As mentioned earlier, the **Begin** component is indispensable for an agent. Still, you can take a look at our 3-step interpreter agent, where the **Begin** component takes global variables.
