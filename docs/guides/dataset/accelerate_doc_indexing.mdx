A checklist to speed up document parsing and indexing.

---

Please note that some of your settings may consume a significant amount of time. If you often find that document parsing is time-consuming, here is a checklist to consider:

- Use GPU to reduce embedding time.
- On the configuration page of your knowledge base, switch off **Use RAPTOR to enhance retrieval**.
- Extracting knowledge graph (GraphRAG) is time-consuming.
- Disable **Auto-keyword** and **Auto-question** on the configuration page of yor knowledge base, as both depend on the LLM.
