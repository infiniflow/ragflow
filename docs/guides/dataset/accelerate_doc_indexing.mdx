A checklist to speed up document parsing and indexing.

---

Please note that some of your settings may consume a significant amount of time. If you often find that document parsing is time-consuming, here is a checklist to consider:

- Use GPU to reduce embedding time.
- On the configuration page of your knowledge base, switch off **Use RAPTOR to enhance retrieval**.
- Extracting knowledge graph (GraphRAG) is time-consuming.
- Disable **Auto-keyword** and **Auto-question** on the configuration page of yor knowledge base, as both depend on the LLM.
- **v0.17.0:** If your document is plain text PDF and does not require GPU-intensive processes like OCR (Optical Character Recognition), TSR (Table Structure Recognition), or DLA (Document Layout Analysis), you can choose **Naive** over **DeepDoc** or other time-consuming large model options in the **Document parser** dropdown. This will substantially reduce document parsing time.
