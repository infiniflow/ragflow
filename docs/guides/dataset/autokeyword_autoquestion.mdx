# Auto-keyword Auto-question
import APITable from '@site/src/components/APITable';

Use a chat model to generate keywords and questions from the original chunks.

---

When selecting a chunking method, you can also enable auto-keyword or auto-question generation to increase retrieval rates. This feature uses a chat model to produce a specified number of keywords and questions from each created chunk, creating a layer of higher-level information from the original content.

:::tip NOTE
Enabling this feature increases document indexing time, as all created chunks will be sent to the chat model for keyword or question generation.
:::

- **Auto-keyword**  
   - **Definition:** The number of additional keywords the LLM generates for each chunk. By supplying synonyms for text that is unfriendly to tokenization or multilingual content, this improves recall for full-text or hybrid retrieval. It can also be used to correct bad cases. Disabling this can significantly accelerate parsing.  
   - **Common Values:**  
     - `0`: Disabled;  
     - `3`-`5` = Recommended (if a chunk has over a thousand characters, more keywords may be needed);  
     - Maximum `30`. Note that, as the number increases, the marginal benefit decreases.  

- **Auto-question**  
   - **Definition:** Generates potential FAQ-style questions for each chunk, making retrieval matches more aligned with real user queries (Who/What/Why).  
   - **Common Values:**  
     - `0` = disabled;  
     - `1–2` = commonly used (if a chunk has thousands of characters, more may be needed);  
     - Upper limit `30` (to avoid generating too many at once). Can also be used to correct bad cases.  
   - **Typical Use Cases:** Scenarios requiring FAQ retrieval, such as product manuals, policy documents, etc.


## Configuration

On the **Configuration** page of your knowledge base, you will find the Auto-keyword and Auto-question sliders under **Page rank**.

:::tip NOTE
The Auto-keyword or Auto-question value must be an integer. If you set their value to a non-integer, say 1.7, it will be rounded down to the nearest integer, which in this case is 1.
