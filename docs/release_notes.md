# Release notes

Key features and improvements in the latest releases.

## v0.14.0

Released on November 26, 2024.

### New features

- Supports [Infinity](https://github.com/infiniflow/infinity) or Elasticsearch (default) as document engine for vector storage and full-text indexing. [#2894](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/pull/2894)
- Enhances user experience by adding more variables to the Agent and implementing auto-saving.
- Adds a three-step translation agent template, inspired by [Andrew Ng's translation agent](https://github.com/andrewyng/translation-agent).
- Adds an SEO-optimized blog writing agent template.
- Provides HTTP and Python APIs for conversing with an agent.
- Supports the use of English synonyms during retrieval processes.
- Optimizes term weight calculations, reducing the retrieval time by 50%.
- Improves task executor monitoring with additional performance indicators.
- Replaces Redis with Valkey.
- Adds three new UI languages (*contributed by the community*): Indonesian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.

### Compatibility changes

As of this release, **service_config.yaml.template** replaces **service_config.yaml** for configuring backend services. Upon Docker container startup, the environment variables defined in this template file are automatically populated and a **service_config.yaml** is auto-generated from it. [#3341](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/pull/3341)

This approach eliminates the need to manually update **service_config.yaml** after making changes to **.env**, facilitating dynamic environment configurations.

:::danger IMPORTANT
Ensure that you [upgrade **both** your code **and** Docker image to this release](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/upgrade_ragflow#upgrade-ragflow-to-the-most-recent-officially-published-release) before trying this new approach.
