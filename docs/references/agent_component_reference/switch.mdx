# Switch component

A component that evaluates whether specified conditions are met and directs the follow of execution accordingly. 

---

A **Switch** component evaluates conditions based on the output of specific components, directing the flow of execution to enable complex branching logic.

## Scenarios

A **Switch** component is essential for condition-based direction of execution flow. While it shares similarities with the [Categorize](https://ragflow.io/docs/dev/categorize_component) component, which is also used in multi-pronged strategies, the key distinction lies in their approach: the evaluation of the **Switch** component is rule-based, whereas the **Categorize** component involves AI and uses an LLM for decision-making. 

## Configurations

### Case n

A **Switch** component must have at least one case. This field sets the conditions and the corresponding downstream component.

#### Condition

- **Component ID**
- **Operator**
  - Equals
  - Not equal
  - Greater than
  - Greater equal
  - Less than
  - Less equal
  - Contains 
  - Not contains 
  - Starts with
  - Ends with
  - Is empty
  - Not empty
- **Value**

#### Next step

Specifies the downstream component of this case.

- Once you specify the ID of the downstream component, a link is established between this case and the corresponding component.
- If you manually link this category to a downstream component on the canvas, the ID of that component is auto-populated.


### ELSE 

Required.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where to specify the data inputs for this component?

The **Switch** component evaluates only whether specific conditions are met and directs the flow of execution accordingly. It does not accept data input, so there is no need to specify data inputs.
