# Concentrator component

A component that directs execution flow to multiple parallel downstream components.

---

The **Concentrator** component acts as a "repeater" of execution flow, transmitting a flow to multiple parallel downstream components.


## Scenarios

A **Concentrator** component enhances the current UX design. For a component originally designed to support only one downstream component, you can append a **Concentrator**, enabling it to have multiple parallel downstream components.
