# Interact component

The component that accepts user inputs and displays responses.

---

The **Interact** component serves as the interface between human and bot, receiving user inputs and displaying the agent's responses.


## Scenarios

A **Interact** component is essential where you need to display the agent's responses or require user-computer interaction.

## Examples

You can explore our three-step interpreter agent template, where the **Interact** component is used to display the final translation, or our customer service agent template, where the **Interact** component is used to display multi-turn dialogue between the user and the agent.
