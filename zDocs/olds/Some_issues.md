## üö® **Runtime Issues That Can Crash Your Backend**

### **üìÅ File Processing Issues**
- Large files (>100MB) causing frontend/CloudFlare timeouts
- Corrupted files crashing MonkeyOCR model loading
- Unsupported file formats not properly rejected
- Binary files disguised as PDFs causing parser crashes
- Files with special characters in names breaking file paths
- Zip bombs or maliciously large compressed files
- Files with excessive page counts (1000+ pages) timing out
- Non-UTF8 encoded filenames causing system errors

### **üíæ Memory & Resource Exhaustion**
- Multiple large files processed simultaneously exhausting GPU memory
- MonkeyOCR model not properly unloaded causing memory leaks
- Redis queue growing infinitely with failed tasks
- Elasticsearch running out of disk space from document chunks
- Container memory limits hit during peak usage
- GPU memory fragmentation from repeated model loading/unloading
- Temporary files not cleaned up filling disk space
- Image processing consuming all available RAM

### **‚è±Ô∏è Timeout & Latency Issues**
- CloudFlare 100-second timeout vs MonkeyOCR 5+ minute processing time
- Load balancer health checks failing during model loading
- Database connection timeouts during heavy processing
- Redis connection timeouts under load
- Frontend timeout shorter than backend processing time
- API gateway timeouts (30s) vs actual processing time (minutes)
- Kubernetes pod readiness probe timeouts
- Model download timeouts on slow networks

### **üîÑ Concurrency & Race Conditions**
- Multiple workers trying to process same task simultaneously  
- Race conditions in task queue claiming/releasing
- Spot instance interruption during critical processing phases
- Model loading conflicts when multiple pods start simultaneously
- File locks conflicts in shared storage
- Database deadlocks during concurrent chunk insertions
- Redis connection pool exhaustion under high load
- GPU resource conflicts between multiple MonkeyOCR instances

### **üéØ Model & AI Processing Failures**
- MonkeyOCR model crashes on specific document types
- GPU out-of-memory errors on high-resolution images
- Model inference hanging indefinitely on corrupted inputs
- CUDA errors causing pod crashes
- Model version compatibility issues
- Invalid model files after partial downloads
- Model tokenizer failures on non-standard text
- Vision model failures on unusual image formats

### **üåê Network & External Service Issues**
- S3 upload failures for large processed documents
- Elasticsearch cluster connection failures
- Redis cluster split-brain scenarios
- External API rate limiting (if using cloud models)
- DNS resolution failures in Kubernetes
- Network partitions between services
- SSL certificate expiration breaking external calls
- VPC connectivity issues

### **üîê Security & Input Validation Issues**
- SQL injection through file metadata
- Path traversal attacks through filenames
- XXE attacks through XML-based documents  
- Denial of Service through resource exhaustion
- Malicious PDFs triggering parser vulnerabilities
- Script injection through document content
- Buffer overflow in native libraries
- Privilege escalation through file processing

### **üóÑÔ∏è Database & Storage Issues**
- Elasticsearch index corruption from incomplete documents
- Redis memory exhaustion from large serialized objects
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Disk space exhaustion from temporary files
- EFS mount failures in Kubernetes
- S3 eventual consistency issues causing data loss
- Database schema migrations during active processing
- Index corruption from concurrent writes

### **üöÄ Scaling & Performance Issues**
- Auto-scaling lag during traffic spikes
- Cold start delays for new MonkeyOCR pods
- Resource contention during peak hours
- Spot instance interruptions during processing bursts
- Load balancer overwhelmed by long-running requests
- Cache invalidation storms
- Database query performance degradation under load
- Memory fragmentation from long-running processes

### **üîÑ Error Handling & Recovery Issues**
- Unhandled exceptions crashing worker processes
- Infinite retry loops for permanently failed tasks
- Partial document processing leaving inconsistent state
- Error cascades when one service fails affecting others
- Missing fallback mechanisms for critical failures
- Silent failures not properly logged or monitored
- Recovery processes failing due to corrupt state
- Dead letter queue overflow

### **üìä Monitoring & Observability Blind Spots**
- No alerts for gradually degrading performance
- Missing metrics for MonkeyOCR processing stages
- Log volume overwhelming storage during issues
- No visibility into GPU utilization
- Missing detection of memory leaks
- No tracking of file processing success rates
- Lack of distributed tracing for complex failures
- Missing business metric monitoring (documents processed per hour)

### **üîß Configuration & Environment Issues**
- Environment variable changes causing service restarts
- ConfigMap updates not properly reloaded
- Secret rotation breaking service authentication
- Resource limit changes causing pod evictions
- Kubernetes version upgrades breaking compatibility
- Library version conflicts after updates
- Time zone issues in multi-region deployments
- Feature flag changes causing unexpected behavior

These are all **real production issues** that can crash your backend when users actually start using the system! üí•
