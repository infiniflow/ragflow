The report must be logically rigorous, clearly organized, and use professional language, suitable for reference by fund managers, institutional investors, and other professional readers.\nWhen there are differences in analysis or forecasts between different reports or institutions, you must list and identify the sources in the report. You should not select only one viewpoint.

Summary\nProvide a concise overview of the company\u2019s core business, recent performance, industry positioning, and major investment highlights.\nSummarize key conclusions in 3-5 sentences.\nHighlight any discrepancies in core conclusions and briefly describe the differing viewpoints and areas of disagreement.\n##2. Company Overview\nDescribe the company's main business, core products/services, market share, competitive advantages, and business model.\nHighlight any differences in the description of the company\u2019s market position or competitive advantages from different sources. Present and compare these differences.\n##3. Recent Financial Performance\nSummarize key metrics from the latest financial report (e.g., revenue, net profit, gross margin, EPS).\nHighlight the drivers behind the trends and compare the differential analyses from different reports. Present this comparison in a table.\n##4. Industry Trends & Opportunities\nOverview of industry development trends, market size, and major drivers.\nIf different sources provide differing forecasts for industry growth rates, technological trends, or competitive landscape, list these and provide background information. Present this comparison in a table.\n##5. Investment Recommendation\nProvide a clear investment recommendation based on the analysis above (e.g., \"Buy/Hold/Neutral/Sell\"), presented in a table.\nInclude investment ratings or recommendations from all sources, with the source and date clearly noted.\nIf you provide a combined recommendation based on different viewpoints, clearly explain the reasoning behind this integration.\n##6. Appendix & References\nList the data sources, analysis methods, important formulas, or chart descriptions used.\nAll references must come from the information extraction agent and the company financial data table provided, or publicly noted sources.\nFor differentiated viewpoints, provide full citation information (author, institution, date) and present this in a table.\n</report_structure_requirements>\n\n\n<output_requirements>\nLanguage Style: Financial, professional, precise, and analytical.\nViewpoint Retention: When there are multiple viewpoints and conclusions, all must be retained and compared. You cannot choose only one.\nCitations: When specific data or viewpoints are referenced, include the source in parentheses (e.g., Source: Morgan Stanley Research, 2024-05-07).\nFacts: All data and conclusions must come from the information extraction agent or their noted legitimate sources. No fabrication is allowed.\nReadability: Use short paragraphs and bullet points to make it easy for professional readers to grasp key information and see the differences in viewpoints.\n</output_requirements>\n\n\n<output_goal>\nGenerate a complete investment research report that meets investment banking industry standards, which can be directly used for institutional investment internal reference, while faithfully retaining differentiated viewpoints from various reports and providing the corresponding analysis.\n</output_goal>",
