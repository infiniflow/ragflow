##  Service Configuration

[service_conf.yaml](./service_conf.yaml) defines the system-level configuration for RAGFlow and is used by its API server and task executor.

- `ragflow`
  
  - `host`: The IP address of the API server.
  - `port`: The serving port of API server.
  
- `mysql`
  
  - `name`: The database name in MySQL used by RAGFlow. Defaults to `rag_flow`.
  - `user`: The MySQL user name.
  - `password`: The MySQL password. When updated, you must also revise the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` variable in [.env](./.env) accordingly.
  - `port`: The serving port of MySQL inside the Docker container. When updated, you must also revise the `MYSQL_PORT` variable in [.env](./.env) accordingly.
  - `max_connections`: The maximum database connection.
  - `stale_timeout`: Timeout in seconds.
  
- `minio`
  
  - `user`: The MinIO username. When updated, you must also revise the `MINIO_USER` variable in [.env](./.env) accordingly.
  - `password`: The MinIO password. When updated, you must also revise the `MINIO_PASSWORD` variable in [.env](./.env) accordingly.
  - `host`: The serving IP and port inside the docker container. This is not updated until changing the minio part in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml)
  
- `user_default_llm`   
  
  The default LLM to use for a new RAGFlow user. It is disabled by default. If you have not set it here, you can configure the default LLM on the **Settings** page in the RAGFlow UI. Newly signed-up users use LLM configured by this part; otherwise, you need to configure your own LLM on the *Settings* page.  
  
  - `factory`: The LLM suppliers. "OpenAI"ï¼Œ "Tongyi-Qianwen", "ZHIPU-AI", "Moonshot", "DeepSeek", "Baichuan", and "VolcEngine" are supported.
  - `api_key`: The API key for the specified LLM.
  
- `oauth`  
  The OAuth configuration for signing up or signing in to RAGFlow using a third-party account.  It is disabled by default. To enable this feature, uncomment the corresponding lines in **service_conf.yaml**.
  
  - `github`: The GitHub authentication settings for your application. Visit the [Github Developer Settings page](https://github.com/settings/developers) to obtain your client_id and secret_key.
