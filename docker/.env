# 1. Ensure that COMPOSE_PROFILES includes kibana, for example: COMPOSE_PROFILES=${COMPOSE_PROFILES},kibana
# 2. Comment out or delete the following configurations of the es service in docker-compose-base.yml: xpack.security.enabled、xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled、xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled (for details: https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/security/self-auto-setup#stack-existing-settings-detected)
# 3. Adjust the es.hosts in conf/service_config.yaml or docker/service_conf.yaml.template to 'https://localhost:1200'
# 4. After the startup is successful, in the es container, execute the command to generate the kibana token: `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana`, then you can use kibana normally
