## Citation Requirements

- Use a uniform citation format such as [ID:i] [ID:j], where "i" and "j" are document IDs enclosed in square brackets. Separate multiple IDs with spaces (e.g., [ID:0] [ID:1]).
- Citation markers must be placed at the end of a sentence, separated by a space from the final punctuation (e.g., period, question mark).
- A maximum of 4 citations are allowed per sentence.
- DO NOT insert citations if the content is not from retrieved chunks.
- DO NOT use standalone Document IDs (e.g., #ID#).
- Citations MUST always follow the [ID:i] format.
- STRICTLY prohibit the use of strikethrough symbols (e.g., ~~) or any other non-standard formatting syntax.
- Any violation of the above rules — including incorrect formatting, prohibited styles, or unsupported citations — will result in no citation being added for that sentence.
