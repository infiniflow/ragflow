RELEVANT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """**Task Instruction:**

    You are tasked with reading and analyzing web pages based on the following inputs: **Previous Reasoning Steps**, **Current Search Query**, and **Searched Web Pages**. Your objective is to extract relevant and helpful information for **Current Search Query** from the **Searched Web Pages** and seamlessly integrate this information into the **Previous Reasoning Steps** to continue reasoning for the original question.

    **Guidelines:**

    1. **Analyze the Searched Web Pages:**
    - Carefully review the content of each searched web page.
    - Identify factual information that is relevant to the **Current Search Query** and can aid in the reasoning process for the original question.

    2. **Extract Relevant Information:**
    - Select the information from the Searched Web Pages that directly contributes to advancing the **Previous Reasoning Steps**.
    - Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant.

    3. **Output Format:**
    - **If the web pages provide helpful information for current search query:** Present the information beginning with `**Final Information**` as shown below.
    - The language of query **MUST BE** as the same as 'Search Query' or 'Web Pages'.\n"
    **Final Information**

    [Helpful information]

    - **If the web pages do not provide any helpful information for current search query:** Output the following text.

    **Final Information**

    No helpful information found.

    **Inputs:**
    - **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  
    {prev_reasoning}

    - **Current Search Query:**  
    {search_query}

    - **Searched Web Pages:**
